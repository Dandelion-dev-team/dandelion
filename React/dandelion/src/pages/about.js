            <h3>The Dandelion School Growing Initiative</h3>
            <p>
              School children will become citizen scientists in the largest
              community-led growing experiment ever undertaken in Scotland,
              comparing future farming techniques with traditional growing. 200
              cubes will be distributed to schools to test whether different LED
              lights can help or hinder growth, or if jazz is better for
              sprouting seeds than hip hop. Theyâ€™ll also be part of the Big
              Tattie Experiment, with 200 tonnes of specially made growing
              medium taken home to grow potatoes in anything from wheelbarrows
              to wellies. Data will be shared on the Dandelion digital platform,
              so you can find out everything from what helped to grow the
              biggest beetroot, to exactly how good it all tasted. Children will
              then be invited to share what they grow at hundreds of playground
              harvest festivals happening at each school on 9th September 2022,
              alongside art, live music, and stories. The Schools Growing
              Initiative is delivered in partnership with Keep Scotland
              Beautiful, a charity providing education initiatives for children,
              young people and educators which focus on environmental issues.
