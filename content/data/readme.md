Sensor data is uploaded here.

Each node is represented by a subdirectory whose name matches the node id.

Current functionality assumes that all data from a node will be stored in a
single csv file. However, the subdirectory structure allows that to be changed
in case it is convenient to split the data into different files.

The filename is *data.csv* so that for a node with id 123, the path would be

`/content/data/123/data.csv`
