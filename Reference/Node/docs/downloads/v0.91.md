# Version 0.91 release notes

## Summary

This is a bug fix release that resolves the issues described below

* **Large data transfers**: Long messages were being formatted incorrectly and
this was preventing sensor data being uploaded successfully. The formatting 
has been corrected.

* **Misleading battery indicator**: As mentioned below, the battery indicator was 
providing unreliable information. It has been removed in this release to be 
reinstated once the problems are resolved.

* **Unreliable wifi connection in config mode**: Some units required several 
attempts before a successful connection could be established in configuration 
mode. Some minor changes have been made to help with this issue although more 
feedback is needed before the problem can be considered fixed.

## Known issues

* **Date and time**: The node currently attempts to obtain the date and time from the wifi network. Setting the date and time in configuration mode therefore has no effect.
* **Battery indicator**: The battery indicator is not currently reliable.
* **Sensor calibration**: For best accuracy, the pH, EC and moisture sensors should be calibrated. Currently, a generic calibration is used.
