## Features

* Sensor reading
* Wifi connection
* Encrypted communications

## Known issues

* **Date and time**: The node currently attempts to obtain the date and time from the wifi network. Setting the date and time in configuration mode therefore has no effect.
* **Battery indicator**: The battery indicator is not currently reliable.
* **Sensor calibration**: For best accuracy, the pH, EC and moisture sensors should be calibrated. Currently, a generic calibration is used.
