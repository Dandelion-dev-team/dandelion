# Sensors

Your node includes five types of sensor that monitor the air and substrate conditions in
your GrowCube planting trays. The atmospheric sensors are housed within the black sensor 
enclosure like the one shown below. The substrate sensors are probes that need to be inserted 
into the growing substrate. They are connected to the sensor enclosure with cables.
