# Sensors

Your node includes six sensors that monitor the air and substrate conditions in
the upper planting tray. The atmospheric sensors are housed within the black sensor 
enclosure shown below. The substrate sensors are probes that need to be inserted into the 
growing substrate. They are connected to the sensor enclosure with cables.
