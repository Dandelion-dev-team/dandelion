# Top layer sensors

The unit in the top layer of the GrowCube houses the atmospheric sensors as well as the substrate
probes. It is therefore more complex than the units in the other two layers.

In the original design, a substrate moisture probe was included as pictured below. However, 
this sensor became redundant with the move to growfelt as a substrate rather than rockwool. It is
therefore not used in the current version of the node. If it gets in the way, this sensor can be
safely removed from the top-layer unit either by simply cutting the wires close to the enclosure,
or by opening the enclosure and unplugging the sensor from the circuit board.

??? danger "What can go wrong?"

    * When placing your top-layer sensor unit, make sure that the light intensity sensor is not
    obscured. That will prevent the light getting in and the node will think it is always dark.

    * The black tape that holds the two halves of the enclosure together can become detatched.
    If this happens, feel free to replace it.
