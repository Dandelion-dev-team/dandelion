# Node registration

To ensure that the data that is uploaded by your node is correctly associated
with your school, your node needs to be registered. This is a simple process
of entering the MAC address of your node into the superuser dashboard in the
Dandelion app.

Once this is done, you will be able to see the details of your node in the app
and you will receive alerts if anything goes wrong or needs checking.
