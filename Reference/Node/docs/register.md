# Node registration

To ensure that the data that is uploaded by your node is correctly associated
with your school, your node needs to be registered. This is a simple process
of entering the MAC address of your node into the superuser dashboard in the
Dandelion app.

Once this is done, you will be able to see the details of your node in the app
and you will receive alerts if anything goes wrong or needs checking.

**Please note**: the registration function is not currently enabled in the app.
It will be in place from Friday 13 May and you will find it on your *Settings*
page. In the meantime, you can install your node and connect it to the wifi so
that it can start collecting data. Once the node is registered, the collected
data will be processed correctly.
