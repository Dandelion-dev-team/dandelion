# Installation

The T5 microprocessor is attached to a set of sensors via a grey ribbon cable.
The sensor are housed in a black enclosure which has several probes emerging.
Currently, only one set of sensors has been included; eventually there will be
three, one for each level in the GrowCube.

Installation simply involves placing the sensors in the top level of the 
GrowCube and the T5 on the top. We recommend that you secure the T5 enclosure
with some double-sided tape to prevent it slipping on the top of the GrowCube
or being accidentally knocked off.

The sensor enclosure should be placed in the near right-hand corner of the
top level tray as shown below. The ribbon cable should fit easily through the 
gap at the top of the doors.

The node is powered by a 3.7v lithium polymer (LiPo) battery, and so it does 
not need to be connected to a mains supply. From time to time, the battery will
need to be recharged. To do this, connect the T5 unit to a power source using
the micro USB connector. The power source could be a USB mains adapter or a
computer. You should charge your battery for a couple of hours when you first
receive it. Please note that access to the USB connector is very tight. You may
need to pop open the enclosure to insert the changing cable. Alternatively, you
could trim the excess plastic down the sides of the cable connector so that it
fits easily.
