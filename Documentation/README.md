# Dandelion documentation

This is the main documentation folder for the system design. The sections below
provide some notes on how to use it.

## Diagrams.net

Diagrams are generally done using [diagrams.net](https://www.diagrams.net/).
There is an integration between this tool and GitHub that lets you open a diagram
directly from the repo, and save any changes with a commit message. To do that,
use the online version of the tool with this URL: [https://app.diagrams.net/?mode=github](https://app.diagrams.net/?mode=github).
You can then just follow the usual procedure for opening an existing file,
but the difference is that you are browsing the GitHub folder rather than
your local file system.

## ER diagram

The ER diagram is produced using [diagrams.net](https://www.diagrams.net/).
The file `ER diagram dandelion.drawio` is in XML format and cannot be viewed
in the GitHub preview pane.
It can be viewed and edited either with the online version of diagrams.net or
the desktop app. See the notes above on opening the file directly from GitHub.
To load the diagram, just follow the instructions when the app starts. 

If you are not using the GitHub integration, local changes
are automatically saved as you go along.

For notes on ER diagram style, please see the notes [here](https://bdavison.napier.ac.uk/db/Practicals/Drawio/erd/)
which also cover the general use of the diagrams.net tool.

## Use case diagram

The use case diagram is produced using [diagrams.net](https://www.diagrams.net/).
The file `Use cases.drawio` is in XML format and cannot be viewed
in the GitHub preview pane.
It can be viewed and edited either with the online version of diagrams.net or
the desktop app. See the notes above on opening the file directly from GitHub.
To load the diagram, just follow the instructions when the app starts. 

If you are not using the GitHub integration, local changes
are automatically saved as you go along.

## API spec

The API spec is produced using the [Swagger editor](https://editor.swagger.io).
The file `openapi.yaml` is in [YAML](https://www.cloudbees.com/blog/yaml-tutorial-everything-you-need-get-started) format.
To load the data, open the editor and choose *Import file* from the *File* menu
as shown below.
